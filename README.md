# Sharrows

### Ever wanted to shoot blocks and items alongside your arrows?
Enjoy the luxury of flying items with Sharrows!
Transfer goods, place blocks, and reign firey explosions.

## Features
Sharrows are a combination of an arrow and any item.
(NBT items are supported.)
You can craft them like so:

When an arrow is combined with a block, the block will be placed upon landing, if possible.
Otherwise, the attached item will be flown off of the arrow as a dropped item!

Watch out for fire and explosions, as Flaming TNT Sharrows can place and ignite TNT all in one go!

Hovering over a Sharrow in the inventory will show you the item contained inside:

Happy shooting!
